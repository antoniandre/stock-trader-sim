## JS
- use standard JS styleguide
- use strostrup braces style, and if single instruction keep on 1 line without braces
- don't spend time fixing linter errors and don't add an ESLint disable comment:
  just ignore them except the `forEach` conversion to `for in`

## SCSS
- if only a single rule in scope, keep on one line
